Project of The Complete Web Developer Course 2.0

## Description
This is the first project I share on Github, it was made for my Udemy Course The Complete Web Developer Course 2.0 made by Rob Percival, Using: Bootstrap, Jquery, PHP and MySql. 
The project is far from perfect, still have a bug where if something is added to the DB and then an old entry is loaded the textarea doesnt refresh (this happens all browsers tested except in IE). Would like some feedback on my code, planning to come back to this project later to improve it further.
